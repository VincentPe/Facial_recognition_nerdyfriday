# Facial Recognition Nerdy Friday
The idea is to get together with the data team once a month and work on an interesting topic that we normally wouldn't cover in our line of work, but can be fun and meaningful to experiment with.
We prepared a training about facial recognition and put together a video of (old) music clips. It was fun to see that the algorithms did not get fooled by Dave's (Foo fighters) dress ups, and even recognized 
the white Michael Jackson (after much plastic surgery) while being trained on photo's of a black MJ!

## Instructions
“The hardest part about using deep learning API’s is the software installations.”

Download VMWare: https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html
Download de pre-configured VM: http://ml.cdyne.com/Deep_Learning_Ubuntu_16.04_16-bit_2018_update.tar.gz 

The pre-cinfigured VM has all the required packages and dependencies ready to run the code without any hassle.
